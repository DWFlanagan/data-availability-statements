# Data availability statements

Chris Graf wants to be able to analyze the data availability statements we receive with actual submissions to see how they are used and if there are trends in the data.

The analysis should be ready for International Data Week in November.

The different templates are listed on the [Author Services](https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/data-sharing-citation/data-sharing-policy.html) website.

We can get the data from the Submissions database on Netezza.

First step would be to cluster the statements from Netezza (about 17K?). Possibly also do sentiment analysis ("we did deposit the data" vs. "we did *not* deposit the data").
